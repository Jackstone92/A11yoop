    ///
    /// - **get**: Returns an accessibility feature from the store that is stored against a corresponding feature type, if at all present in the store.
    ///
    /// - **getAll**: Returns all accessibility features that are present in the store. These are sorted by their corresponding accessibility feature type descriptions.
    ///
    /// - **insert**: Inserts a new accessibility feature into the store against a specified feature type.
    ///            Note that these should be unique and subsequent insertions against the same feature type will cause the accessibility feature to be overwritten.
    ///
    /// - **Update**: Updates the status of an accessibility feature in the store for a given feature type.
    ///             If no accessibility feature is currently stored against the provided feature type then nothing will be updated.
    ///
    /// - **Remove**: Removes an accessibility feature that is currently stored against a given feature type.
